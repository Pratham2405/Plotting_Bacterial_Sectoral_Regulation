# Bacterial Growth Analysis: Sectoral Models Comparison

A comprehensive study analyzing the sensitivity of choice of sectoral models on bacterial growth dynamics, comparing PTR, PTRWF, and min() models to understand their limitations and advantages in different environmental conditions.

## Project Summary & Key Objectives
This project investigates bacterial growth laws through computational modeling using three sectoral models of increasing complexity. The study focuses on how bacteria allocate resources between different protein sectors (ribosomes, transporters, metabolic proteins) and how regulatory mechanisms affect growth in both stable and fluctuating environments
